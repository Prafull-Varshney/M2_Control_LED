## Introduction!

AVR microcontrollers are very easy to use. All AVR microcontrollers require Integrated Development Environment(IDE) such as Atmel Studio. Using this IDE, we can create, compile and debug program on all AVR microcontrollers.
Here we are going learn how to control the working of two LEDâ€™s using a push button switch. Similar to the earlier circuit, first we will connect the 2 LEDs with PB2 and PB3 of  PORTB of the microcontroller.
